\begin{enumerate}
%\item Create videos for each lab so that they can watch and correct themselves
%\item How to grading the labs especially script execution recording with a lot of symbols 
\item Major steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Using vim to create a file, eg. vim scriptfilename
\item Write code in the file, starting the code with ``\#!/bin/bash"
\item Finish the code and save it by click ESC, type  ``:wq"
\item Change the permission to executable: ``chmod u+x scriptfilename"
\item Execute the script by ``./scriptfilename"
\end{enumerate}

\item Extra credits for you to upgrade your score:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Repeat code in slides
\item Repeat code in democode pdf in iLearn
\item Submit in iLearn before the end of next week April 3rd to get credits
\end{enumerate}

\item If you appear ``.filename.swp" problem, it means you did not exit the vim correctly and a swap file has created to save the changes in buffer. Swap file also provides a way to avoid multiple instances of Vim from editing the same file. What you need is to type the command ``rm .filename.swp".
