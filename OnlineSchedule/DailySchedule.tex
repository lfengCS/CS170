\item You can also raise your hand in the ``Participants" menu/option, then I will unmute you
\item You can chat under the ``More" option, depending on which window/app of mine I'm sharing, I may or may not see the chat window all the time but when I see it I will answer it after the current thoughts
\item Office hour can also be held by using ``Waiting room" option in Zoom
